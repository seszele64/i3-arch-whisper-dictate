## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dual logging (file + database)
The system SHALL write logs to BOTH file (stderr/stdout fallback) AND database for reliability.

#### Scenario: Log to both file and database on each log call
- **WHEN** the application logs a message at any level
- **THEN** the system writes the log to the standard file handler (stderr/stdout) AND stores a copy in the database with level, message, source, timestamp, and optional metadata

#### Scenario: Ensure log persistence even if database fails
- **WHEN** database logging fails but file logging succeeds
- **THEN** the system continues operating without interruption, ensuring critical logs are not lost

---

### Requirement: Database logging
The system SHALL store application logs in the database for structured querying.

#### Scenario: Log to database on each log call
- **WHEN** the application logs a message at any level
- **THEN** the system stores the log entry in the database with level, message, source, timestamp, and optional metadata

#### Scenario: Include source module in log entry
- **WHEN** a log entry is created
- **THEN** the system records the source module (e.g., `whisper_dictate.audio`) that generated the log

#### Scenario: Store structured metadata with log
- **WHEN** logging with additional context data
- **THEN** the system serializes the metadata as JSON and stores it in the log entry

---

### Requirement: Query logs from database
The system SHALL provide a command to query and display logs.

#### Scenario: View recent logs
- **WHEN** the user runs the `logs` command
- **THEN** the system displays recent log entries with timestamp, level, source, and message

#### Scenario: Filter logs by level
- **WHEN** the user runs `logs --level ERROR`
- **THEN** the system displays only log entries at the specified level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

#### Scenario: Filter logs by source
- **WHEN** the user runs `logs --source whisper_dictate.transcription`
- **THEN** the system displays only log entries from that source module

#### Scenario: Filter logs by date range
- **WHEN** the user runs `logs --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD`
- **THEN** the system displays only log entries within that date range

#### Scenario: Limit log results
- **WHEN** the user runs `logs --limit N`
- **THEN** the system displays only the N most recent log entries

---

### Requirement: Export logs
The system SHALL provide functionality to export logs.

#### Scenario: Export logs to file
- **WHEN** the user runs `logs export <filename>`
- **THEN** the system exports the filtered log entries to the specified file in text format

---

### Requirement: Log retention
The system SHALL manage log retention automatically.

#### Scenario: Auto-cleanup old logs
- **WHEN** the application starts and log retention is configured
- **THEN** the system deletes log entries older than the configured retention period (default: 30 days)

#### Scenario: Configure log retention
- **WHEN** the user sets a log retention period
- **THEN** the system respects the configured period and cleans up accordingly
