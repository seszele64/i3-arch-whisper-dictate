## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Database initialization on first run
The system SHALL use Python's standard library `sqlite3` (instead of `aiosqlite`) for all database operations. All operations are synchronous — no `asyncio.run()` wrappers needed.

#### Scenario: Initialize database on first run
- **WHEN** the application starts and the database file does not exist
- **THEN** the system creates the database at `~/.local/share/whisper-dictate/whisper-dictate.db` using `sqlite3.connect()` with all required tables

#### Scenario: Skip initialization when database exists
- **WHEN** the application starts and the database file already exists
- **THEN** the system opens the existing database using `sqlite3.connect()` without recreating tables

#### Scenario: Create database directory if missing
- **WHEN** the application starts and the parent directory does not exist
- **THEN** the system creates the directory structure before creating the database

---

### Requirement: Database schema: recordings table
The system SHALL use `sqlite3` library (Python standard library) for synchronous SQLite operations.

- **THEN** the system creates a `recordings` table with the following schema:
  - `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
  - `file_path` TEXT NOT NULL (path to audio file)
  - `timestamp` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (SQLite datetime format)
  - `duration` REAL (recording duration in seconds)
  - `format` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'wav' (audio format)
  - `sample_rate` INTEGER (audio sample rate, e.g., 16000, 44100)
  - `channels` INTEGER (number of audio channels)

---

### Requirement: Database schema: transcripts table
The system SHALL store transcripts associated with recordings.

#### Scenario: Create transcripts table with proper schema

  - `text` TEXT NOT NULL (transcribed text)
  - `language` TEXT (detected language code)
  - `model_used` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'whisper-1' (Whisper model identifier)
  - `confidence` REAL (Whisper confidence score 0.0-1.0)
  - `timestamp` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (SQLite datetime format)

  - `message` TEXT NOT NULL
  - `source` TEXT (module name, e.g., `whisper_dictate.audio` - nullable for flexibility)
  - `timestamp` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (SQLite datetime format)
  - `metadata_json` TEXT (optional JSON-serialized metadata)

---

### Requirement: Database schema: state table
The system SHALL provide a key-value store for persisting application state and settings.

#### Scenario: Create state table with proper schema
- **WHEN** the database is initialized

  - `value_json` TEXT NOT NULL (JSON-serialized state value)
  - `updated_at` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (SQLite datetime format)

#### Scenario: Upsert state values
- **WHEN** setting a state value with a key that already exists

---

### Requirement: Database schema versioning
The system SHALL track the database schema version to enable future migrations.

#### Scenario: Store schema version in database

---

### Requirement: Timestamp format specification
The system SHALL use SQLite's native datetime format for all timestamp columns.

#### Scenario: Timestamp format compatibility
- **WHEN** timestamps are created using `datetime('now')`
- **THEN** the system produces timestamps in SQLite format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `2026-03-13 15:27:50`)

---

### Requirement: Performance indexes
The system SHALL create database indexes to optimize query performance.

#### Scenario: Create indexes on initialization
- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates the following indexes:
  - `idx_recordings_timestamp` on `recordings(timestamp)` - for time-based queries
  - `idx_transcripts_recording_id` on `transcripts(recording_id)` - for joining with recordings
  - `idx_transcripts_timestamp` on `transcripts(timestamp)` - for time-based queries
  - `idx_logs_level` on `logs(level)` - for filtering by log level
  - `idx_logs_timestamp` on `logs(timestamp)` - for time-based queries
  - `idx_logs_source` on `logs(source)` - for filtering by source module

---

### Requirement: Recording metadata storage
The system SHALL store recording metadata in the database after transcription.

#### Scenario: Store recording metadata after transcription
- **WHEN** a recording is successfully transcribed
- **THEN** the system stores the recording file path, timestamp, duration, and format in the `recordings` table

#### Scenario: Retrieve recording by ID

#### Scenario: Enable WAL mode on new database
- **WHEN** a new database connection is established
- **THEN** the system executes `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` to enable WAL mode

#### Scenario: Verify WAL mode is persistent
- **WHEN** an existing database with WAL mode is reopened
- **THEN** the system verifies `PRAGMA journal_mode` returns `wal`

#### Scenario: WAL mode provides crash recovery
- **WHEN** the application crashes or is terminated unexpectedly
- **THEN** the WAL mode ensures no data corruption and enables recovery on restart
