"""
WHY THIS EXISTS: i3 notifications are used throughout the application to provide
user feedback for recording states, transcription results, and error conditions.
Centralizing this prevents inconsistent notification styling and makes it easier
to maintain notification behavior across the application.

RESPONSIBILITY: Provide a clean, type-safe interface for sending desktop notifications
in i3 window manager environments.

BOUNDARIES:
- DOES: Send desktop notifications with configurable urgency, timeout, and content
- DOES NOT: Handle notification history, interactive notifications, or sound alerts
- DEPENDS ON: notify-send command being available in the system
- USED BY: toggle_dictate.py and other modules that need user feedback

ðŸ§  ADHD CONTEXT: Having a single, well-documented function for notifications
prevents the cognitive load of remembering notify-send syntax and parameters.
