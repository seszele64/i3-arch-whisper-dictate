"""Audio format conversion from WAV to MP3 using pydub.

WHY THIS EXISTS: WAV files are large (~10MB per minute at 44.1kHz stereo) and
the Whisper API supports MP3 natively. Converting to MP3 achieves 80-90% size
reduction with no impact on transcription quality for speech.

RESPONSIBILITY: Convert WAV audio files to MP3 format using pydub with FFmpeg backend.
BOUNDARIES:
- DOES: Convert WAV files to MP3, handle graceful fallback when FFmpeg unavailable
- DOES NOT: Handle transcription, recording, or storage management

DEPENDENCIES:
- pydub: Audio format conversion library
- FFmpeg: Audio encoding backend (system dependency)

GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
- If FFmpeg is unavailable, logs a warning and returns the original WAV path
- The system continues to function with larger file sizes
